    "The depth-first search and breadth-first search considered in the previous lesson are completely *blind* algorithms: they're only concerned whether the currently considered state is a goal state or not. They're unable to distinguish whether a state is easy or hard to reach, or whether it is near or far of the goal. This makes them very inefficient search algorithms. To allievate the issue, we introduce informed search algorithms. The information is given to an algorithm in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using an *action cost* function $c(s,a)$, which, given a state $s$ and an action $a$ available in this state, returns its cost as a non-negative number.\n",
    "2. By using a *heuristic* $h(s)$, which, given a state, estimates the lowest cost to reach a goal state from the given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of actions $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ and an initial state $s_1$, we can express the *total cost* of reaching the state $s_{n+1}$ by executing the sequence as:\n",
    "$$ c(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c(s_i, a_i) $$\n",
    "and the *expected cost* of the solution as the sum of the total cost and the estimate cost of reaching the goal from the state $s_{n+1}$\n",
    "$$ f(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = c(s_1, a_1, \\ldots, a_n) + h(s_{n+1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic function is a bit tricky, because we want it to have two properties:\n",
    "* *Admissibility*: It must never *overestimate* the true cost of reaching the goal. \n",
    "* *Consistency*: Let $s$ be a state such that $a$ is an available action in this state and $s'$ is the state reached by executing this action. The heuristic should fulfil triangle inequality, that is, the estimated cost to reach the goal from $s$ should be no greater than the cost of executing the action $a$ + the estimated cost of reaching the goal from the new state.\n",
    "$$ h(s) \\leq c(s, a) + h(s') $$\n",
    "\n",

Both VacuumProblem1 (counting clean rooms) and VacuumProblem2 (10 * dirty rooms) are inadmissible as they overestimate the cost, thus voiding any guarantee of optimality.\n",

Its heuristic value was so large that it effectively overshadowed the true path cost (g(n)), turning A* into a Greedy Best-First Search. In this simple problem, the greedy path happened to be the optimal one. In a more complex scenario, this heuristic would almost certainly have returned a suboptimal path.

    "All three heuristics are admissible, which is why they all correctly found the same optimal path, as confirmed by the output showing `len(plan0) == len(plan1) == len(plan2)`. However, the \"best\" heuristic is not just the one that finds the correct path, but the one that finds it most efficiently. The efficiency is measured by the number of nodes visited during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan Distance heuristic is the most \"informed\" of the three. It provides an estimate h(n) that is much closer to the true cost h^*(n) without ever overestimating it. Because its estimate is more accurate, it allows the A\\* algorithm to be \"smarter\" and waste far less time exploring unpromising paths. This is definitively proven by the output: `PuzzleProblem2` (Manhattan) found the solution by visiting only 4,347 nodes, whereas `PuzzleProblem1` (Misplaced Tiles) required 50,634 nodes and `PuzzleProblem3` (h=0) performed a \"blind\" search, visiting 208,490 nodes. Because it is the most informed admissible heuristic, Manhattan Distance is the most efficient and therefore the best."
